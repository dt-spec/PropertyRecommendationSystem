The next level down (still above grade) has the perfect room to connect you to everything backyard and pool related, and is also where you'll find the laundry. Beyond that, there's another level with a finished rec-room, a storage room, and the mechanicals.

Real wood, hardwood, high ceilings, porches, even a claw foot bath tub. Back then you had prestige when you had a huge formal living room leading to the formal dining room with wood floors , 3 big bedrooms  to accommodate the biggest of bedroom suites.  The oldest of the children would get the bedroom with the sun porch with big windows that let in the natural sunlight.  For extra family space the main floor family room can be a great place for TV time and the patio doors to the deck is easy access to the backyard.  To keep your family warm in the winter the new furnace will do the job.  The subdivision of Renfrew since then has grown  some huge trees making the mature area part of the charm of the area.

It has two decks, a large, level backyard with the mature trees and lawn, and a shed. Inside, the living room is huge with a wood-panelled ceiling that gives it a nautical feeling. The kitchen runs along the back of the house and is bright with an old-fashioned oil-fired stove, a fridge, a farmhouse sink, and a dining space. There are three bedrooms and a bathroom with a shower stall. You have a view of the Bay in the winter season, and the surrounding homes are upscale and permanent ones in this much-sought after seaside area of Boutiliers Point. There is a beach used by local residents at the end of the road, the government wharf and park is just steps away, and Rails To Trails is nearby.

All you\u2019d have to do is add some solar panels and you\u2019re off grid. Lots of room for improvement on investment with a little work. The master bedroom had a wall removed to convert to 1 big bedroom but it could easily be converted back.",

The bungalow does need repairs, including attention needed to its cinder-block foundation and roof, and is being sold as is. It has two decks, a large, level backyard with the mature trees and lawn, and a shed. Inside, the living room is huge with a wood-panelled ceiling that gives it a nautical feeling. The kitchen runs along the back of the house and is bright with an old-fashioned oil-fired stove, a fridge, a farmhouse sink, and a dining space. There are three bedrooms and a bathroom with a shower stall. You have a view of the Bay in the winter season, and the surrounding homes are upscale and permanent ones in this much-sought after seaside area of Boutiliers Point. There is a beach used by local residents at the end of the road, the government wharf and park is just steps away, and Rails To Trails is nearby. This is a great opportunity to renovate or build new.",

And it's rare for me to watch a house rise towards its listing date, like a bubble of air through water, with such anticipation.

That midnight siding like charred Japanese cypress harvested from that soft hillside behind McBurney's old burial ground and its new slides. It is bracingly modern (all those Marvin windows, the steel support beam) and pleasingly traditional. Open-plan but warm. Bright, but with strategically placed shadows to take the glare off a new book. A main floor perfectly organized around a kitchen all butcher block and stamped tin. A minimalist gas stove warming the corner between the living room window and the front door. It has the feel of a sentry, a guard against the cold. Nothing will get in the way of 12 Redan offering a warm greeting.The sitting/dining room at the back of the house is a modern addition, and looks out to the west-facing porch, the lawn, the lush perennial beds, the pretty shed. A top-notch heat pump and new furnace keep a lid on the utility costs, even with the Prius getting plugged in most nights. The upper bathroom was re-done last year with hexagonal tile and a long-legged chrome sink. The softwood floors are beautifully refinished and reflect that this much-improved house sits comfortably alongside its own past, like a couple holding hands.",

Those are the barest of details, but unless you already live in downtown Kingston you might not realize just how rarely that description can be attached to one of the local real estate listings. I live in the same neighbourhood and my house dates to about 1875. Most of the neighbouring properties are over one hundred years old. There just isn't the room for this sort of modern in-fill project. And that's a shame because most days I'd pay a lot for a garage and an almost total absence of maintenance chores. Nothing I can think of here is even halfway through its lifespan. The eat-in kitchen and living room are at the back, collecting all the sunlight, with sliding doors out to the garden. It's a very modern configuration. There's a main-floor laundry and bathroom too. Upstairs, the principal bedroom is very nearly palatial, big enough for dancing, and is being used as a rec room. It makes sense to me and unless your family has grown, numbers-wise, you might set it up the same way. The other two bedrooms are no slouches either, and the overall sense is of a worry-free, reasonably priced home in a hard-to-beat location.",

Nosferatu stashed in the downstairs closet with the lights off. But I'm wrong (again!), and a couch or a stereo will sit snug into the corner, so long as you pick the right corner. To my mind, all this narrowing and widening, the opening up of spaces like a pair of bellows exercising its lungs, just adds to the character of the semi-detached home. It is the quintessential McBurney Park/Inner Harbour residence, adhering addition by addition, to the northern wall of another, older home, like a child who appears suddenly at your hip. There are three bedrooms here, and one bathroom (on the second floor), a really large living room with gas fireplace and oak strip floors, and sliding doors out to the big, private garden, and a cellar you'll mostly ignore, as is the practice downtown. There is also plentiful parking, three spots, and if you don't need them all yourselves, you'll rent them to someone like me, who works downtown and is still reeling from the price increases curtside. The appliances will all stay behind and so there really isn't much to do once your lawyer calls to tell you the sale has closed. Perhaps that's the key at 302: the location at the top of the hill and right downtown. You can walk to Northside in less than ten, and the Grand Theatre in, what, five minutes? McBurney Park might as well be added to your yard, so close is it, and if you fall, all teenage enthusiasm, from one of its towering trees, your friends will have you down at the hospital before you've even properly regained consciousness.

I enjoy their proving that a modest square footage is more than enough for most of us. And that limited resources were used to create some of the most durable homes. I like that people really live together in these places, rather than retreating to separate wings of some lookalike suburban mansion. A small house is cheaper to run and maintain too, and its diminutive footprint leaves room for others to set up shop. They speak eloquently, in other words, of hard work and a sense of community. 318 Queen St is a fine example, a star pupil. The renovations here are extensive and impressive. It was run for a while as a high-end Airbnb and I suppose that's a possible future once more. It's set up with two bedrooms, and works well that way, but you could also use the ground floor bedroom as a sitting room. With pine floors and barn board trim, a good modern kitchen with a gas stove and island, the effect is of a luxurious condominium, only without the monthly maintenance fee (all utilities have averaged only $190 over the last twelve months). The second floor loft and four-piece ensuite have exposed rafters and twin skylights, an old clawfoot tub, and laundry sulking in the corner. You are right downtown, which means all your favourite shops and restaurants are right around the corner, and the university and hospitals are only a short walk. There is even covered parking behind the house, and if you don't need it yourself you'd be wise to rent out a spot or two.",

Step inside from the lengthy covered front porch with stylish integrated feature lighting, and the extent of the updates on offer here is apparent immediately.  All new flooring, trim work, lighting, and a generously sized picture window grace a sitting room that stretches the depth of the home, with a dinette well positioned on the way through to the stunningly finished kitchen.  You name it \u2013 custom cabinetry, quartz counters, subway tile backsplash, soft close drawers, pendant, pot and under cabinet lighting, stainless appliances \u2013 the consummate home chef will want for nothing here.  Backwards just a couple steps are sliders leading out to an enormous elevated deck that overlooks the rear yard.  A great space for grilling, entertaining, or both once warm evenings arrive again.  Down the hall lie the two main level bedrooms (the primary suite absorbs a previously-existent third bedroom to allow space for that massive walk-in closet), and the beautifully finished main four-piece family bath.  Downstairs, the fully finished basement opens with an impressive rec room that features built-in cabinetry and Dolby 5.1 surround sound.  A tidy little laundry nook marks the path to the utility space ahead, while a third bedroom, a three-piece washroom with more in-floor heating, and a nicely sized home office (or potential fourth bedroom) round out the walkout basement.  An attached (and quite deep) single car garage supplements private driveway parking for a total of three spaces to round out this offering.",
